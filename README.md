# Project Title

This is my potfolio project to showcase my skill in Java JDBC. I have also used JavaFX 18 in this project.

Bike Reviewer is a desktop application to rate different bikes using a personalized account.
 
## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

- Since the project was in the form of desktop application I had to learn JavaFX to implement the projects.
- The biggest challenge I came across was the concept of using relative path when referincing the database(.db) & image files in intelliJ idea.
- There was also the concept of passing data objects in different controller files. Additionally the usage & difference between overidden initialize() method & constructors of the same java file.
